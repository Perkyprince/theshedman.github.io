## Instructions

To get started, open `designs.js` and start building out the app's functionality.

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

## Live Page
To test and review the live page for the **Pixel Art Maker** please click [here](https://theshedman.github.io/).

## Added Functionality
I also added some few functionalities like _**Remove Grid**_ and _**Clear Color**_ Buttons. The former will remove the whole grid should you made a mistake and want to remove everything with no intention redrawing a new grid. While the _**Clear Color**_ button will clear the whole color in the grid. This is used when the user is wants to clear the old art on the grid or to draw a new art. Forcing the user to achieve this by clicking on the cells one after the other is boringsome and as well not a great user experience (UX) and so I added the functionality for the task. 

## Slack Handle
My _**slack handle**_ for the [ALC with Google 3.0](alcwithgoogle3.slack.com) is [@Theshedman](https://alcwithgoogle3.slack.com/team/UAKLQ7VJ4). 

## Experience
I gained a lot of experience during the training on Udacity and more during the project. Not only do I learnt how to manipulate the DOM with Javascript and jQuery but I also have the feeling that I can now build an interactive web page. 

## Apreciation
All thanks to [Google](www.google.com), [ALC](https://andela.com), and [Udacity](www.udacity.com) for giving such a wonderful opportunity to learn _**Frontend Web Development**_. This little that I know now has really given my career a new shape of great hope. Thank you so much. You guys are the best. Hopefully believing to make it to the _**Second Phase (NanoDegree)**_ of the scholarship. 

Much love :)
